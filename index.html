	 <p>Like many people, I am passionate about <strong> traveling </strong> and <strong>discovering </strong> what the world has to offer, but my particularity is that I love to travel alone. This has allowed me to make great encounters from all over the world and to see another point of view of travels. Just below is the link of a blog that will make you change your mind about solo travelling, even if you're a 22-year-old girl.</p>

 	<h2>SPORT</h2>

 	<p>I am also very passionate about sports, especially track and field. I practiced this sport for 10 years in competition and I had the chance to participate in 3 French championships in the discipline of 100m hurdles and javelin throwing. Younger, I also took part in a French championship of cross country.
	I practiced other sports in clubs, such as swimming and horse riding.
	Sport teaches us many values such as surpassing oneself and fair play. I had to stop sport a few years ago, due to an injury, but I keep in me the values that these sports have passed on to me.</p>

 	<h2>NEXT STOP: BOGOTA</h2>

 	<p>I was able to improve my English during my trip to Australia in particular. However I am not very good in Spanish.  That's why I wanted to go to South America for my university exchange semester. I am very happy because I have the chance to go to Bogota, Colombia, in 5 months for 6 months. I am expecting a lot from this new experience abroad. It will allow me to travel and discover different countries in South America, I also hope to be able to speak Spanish fluently when I return. It will also allow me to meet Colombian friends that I met during my trip to Australia 3 years ago. I'm really excited about this new adventure!																		</p>
